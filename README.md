Gallery was developed as application that allows you to receive, display data from an external REST API.

The data source was been taken from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/.

Technologies which have been used for the website :

React.js,
SCSS,
Skeleton,
Normalize

Also I worked out on the adaptive design.

In gallery user can:

View a list of the author's albums, where each album consists of a cover, title and number of photos in it

View a list of photos within an album

Open photo in popup for detailed view

Flip album photos inside the popup

Return from a specific album to the album list

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
